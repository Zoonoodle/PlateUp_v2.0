# Firebase Setup Status

## Completed Tasks

1. **Created Firebase Stub Implementations**
   - Added `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/PlateUp_v2/PlateUp/PlateUp/Utilities/FirebaseStubs.swift`
   - Provides temporary stub implementations for all Firebase services
   - Allows project to compile without Firebase SDK installed

2. **Updated Import Statements**
   - Added conditional imports (`#if canImport(...)`) to all Swift files that use Firebase
   - Files updated:
     - PlateUpApp.swift
     - AuthViewModel.swift
     - FirebaseService.swift
     - FirebaseOnboardingService.swift
     - GeminiService.swift
     - SystemMonitor.swift

3. **Fixed Type Conflicts**
   - Resolved ambiguity between Firebase Auth's User type and PlateUp's User model
   - Updated references to use `PlateUp.User` where appropriate
   - Created type aliases for Firebase types in stubs

4. **Added Missing Types**
   - Added PersonalizedRecipe struct to GeminiService.swift
   - Added WeeklyCoachingReport struct
   - Added gradient extensions to Colors.swift
   - Fixed model classes (removed @Observable from Codable structs)

5. **Created Setup Documentation**
   - `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/PlateUp_v2/PlateUp/FIREBASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Manual setup guide
   - `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/PlateUp_v2/PlateUp/add-firebase-dependencies.sh` - Quick reference script
   - `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/PlateUp_v2/PlateUp/configure-firebase.sh` - Automated setup script

## Current Status

The project has been modified to compile without Firebase dependencies by using stub implementations. The build is currently failing due to Swift compilation issues that appear to be related to the Xcode project configuration.

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Add Firebase via Xcode (Recommended)
1. Open `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/PlateUp_v2/PlateUp/PlateUp.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Follow the instructions in `FIREBASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
3. Add Firebase SDK via Swift Package Manager
4. Add GoogleService-Info.plist to the project
5. Clean and rebuild

### Option 2: Continue with Stubs (For Testing)
The project includes complete stub implementations that allow it to compile without Firebase. This is useful for:
- Testing the UI without backend
- Development when Firebase is unavailable
- Initial project setup

### Option 3: Fix Remaining Build Issues
If the build continues to fail after adding Firebase:
1. Delete Derived Data: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData`
2. Clean build folder in Xcode: Cmd+Shift+K
3. Reset Package Caches: File → Packages → Reset Package Caches
4. Restart Xcode

## Firebase Services Used

The project requires these Firebase products:
- **FirebaseCore** - App initialization
- **FirebaseAuth** - User authentication
- **FirebaseFirestore** - Database
- **FirebaseFunctions** - Cloud functions
- **FirebaseStorage** - File storage
- **FirebaseAnalytics** - Analytics
- **FirebaseVertexAI** - Gemini AI integration

## Important Files

- **Firebase Configuration**: `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/PlateUp_v2/PlateUp/GoogleService-Info.plist` (exists, needs to be added to Xcode project)
- **Stub Implementations**: `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/PlateUp_v2/PlateUp/PlateUp/Utilities/FirebaseStubs.swift`
- **Setup Instructions**: `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/PlateUp_v2/PlateUp/FIREBASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## Notes

- The stub implementations will automatically be ignored once Firebase is properly imported (controlled by `#if !canImport(FirebaseCore)`)
- All Firebase usage in the app has been updated to use conditional compilation
- The project structure is ready for Firebase integration via Swift Package Manager
